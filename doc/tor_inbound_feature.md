# Overview

As of mwc-node 4.0.0-beta.1, inbound tor connections are supported natively. By default TOR is off, but it is easy to turn on and in later releases we intend
make it on by default.

# Prerequisites and setup

You must install TOR and include it in your path. On mac, this can be done with the following command:

```# brew install tor```

On Ubuntu Linux:

```# sudo apt install tor```

On PC:

Download the tor browser from [The TOR Project](https://www.torproject.org/download/).
Then add the tor binary (tor.exe) to your path. For instructions on how to do that see [this](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html).
